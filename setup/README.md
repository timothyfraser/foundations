# Course Setup Guide

Welcome to the course setup guide! ðŸŽ‰  
This documentation will walk you through everything you need to get your computer ready for this lab class. Follow each step carefully to ensure your environment is fully configured.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Setup Accomplishes

By the end of this setup, you will have:
- Git version control for tracking and submitting code
- A local AI-powered assistant (LM Studio)
- Python and/or R installed and ready
- An IDE (Cursor, VS Code, or RStudio) with recommended extensions
- Your environment configured with all required dependencies
- A test-verified setup so you can start coding right away

---

## âœ… Your Complete Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Install Git (Version Control)
- **Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**  
  - **What is Git?** A version control system to track code changes, collaborate, and manage assignments  
  - **What you get:** Git Bash (command line) and Git GUI  
  - **Verify installation:** Run `git --version` in your terminal  

---

### Step 2: Install LM Studio (Local AI Assistant)
- **Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/download)**  
  - **What is LM Studio?** A desktop app for running large language models locally  
  - **Why you need it:** Provides AI coding help, even offline  
  - **Alternative:** On Intel-based Macs, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)  

---

### Step 3: Install Programming Languages
Youâ€™ll need at least one programming language for this course:

- **Python**  
  - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  - âœ… Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation  
  - Verify with: `python --version` or `python3 --version`

- **R**  
  - [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)  
  - If you installed **RStudio**, R is already included  
  - Verify with: `R --version`

---

### Step 4: Choose and Install Your IDE (Code Editor)
Pick one IDE for coding (you may install more if youâ€™d like):
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) â€“ AI-powered editor (recommended, free 1 year for students)  
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) â€“ Popular, lightweight, customizable  
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) â€“ Best choice if focusing on R  

ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation:** Use Cursor â€” it integrates AI help directly into your editor.

---

### Step 5: Configure Your Shell Environment
1. Open **Cursor** (or your IDE).  
2. Update your **`.bashrc`** file (your terminal configuration).  
3. Open a **Git Bash** terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   source .bashrc


### Step 6: Install Course Dependencies
- **Run the dependency installation script**
  - Execute: `source setup/dependencies.sh`
  - **What this does:** Installs all required Python packages and R libraries for the course
  - **Expected time:** 5-15 minutes depending on your internet connection

### Step 7: Install Recommended Extensions (Cursor Users)
- **Install the extensions listed in the section below**
  - **Why extensions?** They enhance your coding experience with features like syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and language support

### Step 8: Test Your Setup
- **Create a test file and run it**
  - Try creating a simple Python script or R script
  - Verify that you can run code without errors
  - **Success indicator:** No error messages when running basic code
