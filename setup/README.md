- All necessary dependencies and packages installed

## Your Complete Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Install Git (Version Control)
- **Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**
  - **What is Git?** Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your code files. It's essential for collaborating, backing up your work, and managing different versions of your projects.
  - **What you get:** Git Bash (command line interface) and Git GUI
  - **Why you need it:** You'll use Git to clone course repositories, submit assignments, and track your code changes

### Step 2: Install LM Studio (Local AI Assistant)
- **Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/download)**
  - **What is LM Studio?** A desktop application that allows you to run large language models locally on your computer
  - **Why you need it:** Provides AI assistance even when you're offline, helps with code explanations, and offers privacy for your code
  - **How it helps:** You can ask questions about your code, get debugging help, and learn programming concepts

### Step 3: Install Programming Languages
- **Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
  - **What is Python?** A versatile programming language widely used in data science, web development, and automation
  - **Installation tip:** Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
  - **Verify installation:** Open terminal/command prompt and type `python --version`

- **Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)**
  - **What is R?** A statistical programming language designed for data analysis and visualization
  - **Note:** If you installed RStudio, R is automatically included
  - **Verify installation:** Open RStudio or type `R --version` in terminal

### Step 4: Choose and Install Your IDE (Code Editor)
- **Install your preferred IDE:**

**ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:** We highly recommend **Cursor** for this course as it provides AI assistance that can help you learn and debug code more effectively.

### Step 5: (In your Code Editior, e.g.Cursor) Configure Your Shell Environment
- **Update your `.bashrc` file**
  - **What is .bashrc?** A configuration file that runs commands every time you open a new terminal session
  - **Why update it?** Ensures your development tools are properly configured and accessible

- **Open Git Bash terminal and load settings**
  - Run: `source .bashrc`
  - **What this does:** Applies your configuration changes to the current terminal session

### Step 6: Install Course Dependencies
- **Run the dependency installation script**
  - Execute: `source setup/dependencies.sh`
  - **What this does:** Installs all required Python packages and R libraries for the course
  - **Expected time:** 5-15 minutes depending on your internet connection

### Step 7: Install Recommended Extensions (Cursor Users)
- **Install the extensions listed in the section below**
  - **Why extensions?** They enhance your coding experience with features like syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and language support

### Step 8: Test Your Setup
- **Create a test file and run it**
  - Try creating a simple Python script or R script
  - Verify that you can run code without errors
  - **Success indicator:** No error messages when running basic code

## ðŸš€ Ready to Code!
